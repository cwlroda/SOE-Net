#### Introduction

------

SOE-Net fully explores the relationship between points and incorporates long-range context into point-wise local descriptors. Local information of each point from eight orientations is captured in a PointOE module, whereas long-range feature dependencies among local descriptors are captured with a self-attention unit. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function called Hard Positive Hard Negative quadruplet loss (HPHN quadruplet), that achieves better performance than the commonly used lazy quadruplet loss.
